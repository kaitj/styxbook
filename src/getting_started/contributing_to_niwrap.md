# Contributing to NiWrap

NiWrap is a large collection of Boutiques descriptors for Neuroimaging.

If you think you found a bug in one of the interfaces, or you are missing an interface you can either report it in the [NiWrap issue tracker](https://github.com/styx-api/niwrap/issues), or attempt to fix it yourself.

TODO: Briefly explain boutiques, niwrap repo structure, and have a few examples for how to add a missing argument, change the type of an argument, or add a completely new descriptor or framework. Maybe talk about source extraction.
