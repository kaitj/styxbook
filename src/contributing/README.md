# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Styx ecosystem! This section provides detailed guides for contributing to different components of the project.

## Contribution Areas

The Styx ecosystem consists of several components that work together:

1. **NiWrap** - A collection of Boutiques descriptors for neuroimaging tools
2. **Styx Compiler** - Transforms Boutiques descriptors into type-safe language bindings
3. **Language-specific packages** - The compiled outputs for Python, TypeScript, and R

## Guides in this Section

- [Contributing to NiWrap](./contributing_to_niwrap.md) - Learn how to add or improve neuroimaging tool descriptors
- [Contributing to the Styx compiler](./styx_compiler.md) - Help enhance the core compiler functionality

## Why Contribute?

Your contributions help expand the ecosystem of type-safe neuroimaging tools across multiple programming languages. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding support for a new tool, or improving documentation, your work directly benefits researchers and developers in the neuroimaging community.
